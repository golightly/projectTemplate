note: fonts won't work with letters that are meant to link together.  Not really a problem? When would I really use handwriting
style fonts anyway?

set up editor fonts and text

set up ui (can contain text, images, buttons, can be rendered or not, are constrained to the editor window's dimensions,
can pause the rest of the scene, use function typedef thingy for the buttons)

set up ui for scenes and the editor (in the editor's case, just for the mouse window)

scaling shouldn't be necessary for scenes.  everything will just be larger and the camera will be smaller.  ui will probably
need some sort of scaling though, if it is bound to the screen instead of the scene world.
so, make ui that is bound to the screen use percentages instead of pixels for size, and use the downscaling algorithm on any images and text.

actually, scaling might be necessary for scene objects.  add a percentage attribute to text and image stuff in scene
