text on screen saying left click to flap, everything frozen till you click

at game over a retry button

one background image turned into 6 sprites.  same with the ground sprite.

the background moves faster than the ground, though.

the pipes are 1/2 a tile apart and all have a space 2x as big as the bird between them.

the player scores a point every time they pass the end of a pair of pipes (make sure to trigger this only once, use an invisible collision box that when collided with adds 1 to the score and then moves to the end of the next pipe set (a fixed distance, so it doesn't need to know where the pipes are)

when you get game over, the game stops accepting input except through the two buttons.  make sure the bird can't actually go through the pipes or ground

the score is reset when the player clicks retry
